![ComposableComposition Package Header](Docs/Header.png)

ComposableComposition is a Swift package ðŸ“¦ that extends the fantastic [Swift Composable Architecture (TCA)](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) to provide additional capabilities for composing and handling state and actions. It introduces the concepts of child and parent states and actions, allowing for more granular control over state mutations and action handling, without having to duplicate (and sync) parent state to child features.
